# New Coalition of Nations - Coalition Cartography Authority

Welcome to the official repository for the **Coalition Cartography Authority (CCA)**, the dedicated cartographic service for the **New Coalition of Nations (NCON)**. Here, we meticulously chart and maintain the geopolitical, environmental, and tactical maps of our shared world, **Enkon Delta**.

## About the CCA

The **Coalition Cartography Authority** serves as the official mapmaker for NCON, tasked with the continuous refinement and publication of Enkon Delta’s map. Our work supports role-playing activities, strategic planning, and lore development for the nations within our coalition.

## Enkon Delta: A Living World

Enkon Delta is a dynamic, post-modern tech planet where nations rise and fall, engage in diplomacy, and shape the world’s history. The CCA ensures that all changes, whether territorial, infrastructural, or natural, are reflected accurately in our maps.
