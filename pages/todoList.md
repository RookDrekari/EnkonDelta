# Nedea's TODO/Wish List

Here is my current TODO list and the status of different tasks within the 3.0 project. It is divided into a few subjects and nothing is in any particular order.

## Contents

1. [Cartography](#cartography)
2. [Navigation](#navigation)
3. [Statistics](#statistics)
4. [Wish List](#wish-list)
    1. [Cartographic-Upgrades](#cartographic-upgrades)
    2. [Economics](#economics)

## Cartography

1. Create the landmasses <span style="color:green;">COMPLETE</span>
2. Create the biomes <span style="color:orange;">IN PROGRESS</span>
3. Finalize Sovereignty <span style="color:orange;">IN PROGRESS</span>
4. Establish rules for making claims <span style="color:red;">NOT STARTED</span>
5. Make the map interactive <span style="color:red;">NOT STARTED</span>
    1. Learn more about SVG maps and HTML <span style="color:orange;">IN PROGRESS</span>
    2. Decide whether to link sovereignty to main NS page or Cartographers page <span style="color:red;">NOT STARTED</span>
6. Create a bunch of icons and assets for the map <span style="color:red;">NOT STARTED</span>
7. Publish the Tabula Rasa maps <span style="color:orange;">IN PROGRESS</span>


## Navigation

1. Main Directory
    * Do I even need a seperate page for this or could I just use the README.md?
2. National Directory
3. National Overviews 
4. Design file system
    * Oof
5. NPC Overviews
6. Rules & Regulations
7. Copy/Paste requests
    * VERY IMPORTANT! I will not accept any claims, requests, transfers, etc. that do not adhere to my system.
8. Decide if it's worth it to move all of Nedea's factbooks off NS and into this repository.
9. Create a plethora of templates for nations to fill out their own information to be added to directories.


## Statistics

1. Nail down the import script for the NS api.
2. Choose which data I actually want to import.
3. Fix all the NS statistic buffoonery.
    * This might require it's own page to explain though it will probably be put into a Changeblog.
4. Design a beautiful .md to add the imported info into that is more readable and easier to understand than NS.

## Wish List
Anything you see in here are just projects that might be fun to explore or implement and are not guaranteed to happen. Anything you see above this sectiono takes priority. If you have other suggestions, please contact the [Cartographer](https://www.nationstates.net/page=compose_telegram?tgto=Nedea)

### Cartographic Upgrades

1. Map Layers
    * Most map layers should be managed by other nations. They will have the Tabula Rasa maps to help facilitate this.
    * However, if I find myself with time, I can probably make a couple.
        * Climate
        * Trade
        * Unions
        * Resources
2. Animations
    * Is it possible to animate content in an SVG? YES! Do I know how? NOT YET!
3. Make more things clicky beyond sovereignty.
    * This is extremely dependent on other nations providing content.
    * For example, if a nation writes a factbook for their capital or some other cities, I could make those icons on the map hyperlink to that page.
    * If a nation has an ongoing RP, I could put an icon on the map the represents that RP and then link to the relevant RP.

### Economics

1. International Stock Market
    * Using updated statistics, allow nations to create corporations listed on the DarkHaven Stock Exchange.
    * Nations would name their company, ticker, and then select how much market share (% of some industry) of any particular industries the company controls. We then issue a certain number of shares and divide the market share by the # of shares to get a share price.
    * Share prices would be updated daily at 0:00 UTC as with all statistic updates.
    * Could add a chyron using HTML to the top of the market page.
    * What's cool here is that nations will have some control over the price of their stocks just by simply answering issues.
    * Maybe a basket of regional indexes to invest in?
2. International Banking system
    * Allow nations to have a portion of their total income to be added to a discretionary account they can use for RP purposes or with the stock market.
    * Accounts could be topped off every week maybe?
    * This creates an opportunity for a regional *Global Economics & Trade* activity.
    * Maybe a mechanical answer to the treaty Ath and I worked out?
3. Delta Bazaar
    * Exactly what I mentioned in the banking portion, a regional *Global Economics & Trade* activity.
    * Nations either register products or companies to sell their goods.
    * *Must* be plugged into the IBS... *Somehow*
4. International Trade
    * When the statistics are crunched, it may be possible to see which nations have a surplus or shortfall in a particular industry.
    * Nations can sell their surplus to other nations or an international body.
    * Nations can buy excess to fill gaps in their industries from either other nations or the international body.
    * All NPCs will have randomly assigned surpluses or shortfalls and will fill gaps using the international body.
    * Again, this *must* use the IBS.
