# Changeblog #1

---

Phew, making a whole repository is a lot of work. So many pages and so many broken things everywhere. I appreciate all the comments and attempts at critique so far. It has been super fun building this whole thing out, working on the map, and learning all sorts of new things.

## The Changes

Are there really any changes that can be said when you are creating something entirely new? No, there are not. But! That won't stop me from telling you all the crud I've been getting up to since this project began. 

1. Built a repository to store all this junk in.
2. Started desiging the repo.
3. Got distracted with NS stats, *again*
4. Built the tabula rasa map
5. Reconnected with the region.

Doesn't seem like much when I shorten it up like that but that's what I've been up to. There is still much more to do. This weekend and the following week I am, as many of you might be, busy with festivities. I'm not gonna grind this project 24/7 but I will keep it updated. I have the repo stored here on Github and on three of my machines as well as my phone. So, whenever something comes to mind that I need to change or fix quick, I can.

## The Philosophy

<details>
  <summary>If you recall this post.</summary>
  
I suppose I should go a bit deeper into what I'm doing. I like all the suggestions so far and they are not impossible for me to implement. Before I go over your suggestions, I want to go over a bit of history and the backend of curating the map.

The History, & The Problem

Originally, years ago at this point, we had map 1.0. Map 1.0 sucked. it was just some generated landmasses and a rough paint job. We RP'd a little bit but it was serviceable at bare minimum. Then, after playing around in Paint.net for a while, I had discovered a new method for painting the map and its borders. It allowed for more complex arrangements and style choices. After pitching it to all of you here, we decided to go with map 2.0. 2.0 is the current map we are using. (maybe, it's more like 2.4, I had a little fun). This map has been generally pretty easy to maintain but it can be very tedious at times. It's customizable, and detailed and frankly it looks better than a lot of the other maps I see on NS. But like I said, tedious. The map has outgrown the software I use to update it, paint.net. The main reason we haven't had an update in a while is because it just sucks to do. Each nation has its own layers, color pallets, and other minutia. This on top of the fact that I still haven't completed the geographic features of the map because it is just stitched together pieces from a map generator. Scales are off in some places, edges get weird, and if you look close enough, it gets fuzzy.

So, yea, the current map is good enough, but good enough is not enough for me. It stresses me out just looking at it. It might look fine to some of you, but I can see every flaw and problem with it. Also, IT'S HUGE. I know that it can be slow to load on some people's computers. Now, that might be more of an issue with the host I am using, and I should probably host it on my own servers (Spoiler alert, this is going to happen). All this and there are still more problems.

Map requests are a nightmare. When we get new nations, they look at our map and immediately want space on it. I tell them the same thing each time. "Hey buddy, why don't you talk a bit in the RMB, let us get to know you and try RPing a little bit about your nation before I throw you on the map." Let me share a couple I get.

"hello can i get a uhhh..spot on da north of the sea of rivers thank you"

"hey can u give me a spot on the north of the sea of fourtune on 60.12 direction tnx im waiting"

"Hi there
Hello

I want a space on the map please
Can it be coastal and relatively mountainous please
I also want it to be quite small
I hope this is possible
Thanks!"

Now, I usually send them all the same stuff I posted above. And then they usually ghost us. They either dip, or CTE. So, I'm glad I didn't make any changes to the map. So, this issue is map requests do not have a defined system. When you go to the Delta Episode RP thread, we have 2 links that are kill about the rules and requests. I forgot we had a forum! But that forum is kill :( So, that needs fixing.

Let's break this all down...

The Issues

+ Map is tedious to update.
+ Map has relics that bother me.
+ Map has no concise request system.
+ Map has outgrown the software I use to update it.
+ Map is too big/takes too long to load.
+ Map went from being fun for me, to being a chore.

So, there we have it, a list of all the issues that make me hate even looking at the map. But I want the map to work for everyone and be fun and stimulating for me to work on. Let's talk about some of the requests I've seen.

The Requests

46566 mentioned he would like trade routes to be added to the map. This is pretty simple and could be implemented into the 2.0 map without much effort. Trade routes are generally natural structures that can, as Ath said, evolve and change over time. Like most systems, these routes would follow the "path of least resistance." Port to port. I would probably draw some dotted lines that connect various port cities together with what my best guess would be. I could add big red X's over some of these lanes to symbol shipping disruptions, ala pirate activity, blockades, etc. I could make the lines thicker or thinner depending on the traffic that lane carries. Lines could change in size as the density of trade changes via RP posts and events. All in all, I give this request a gold stamp. NEXT!

Athretvari mentions new geography. Now, I know this isn't a request but something I want to talk about anyway. Geography is one of the most important features of any map. People have preferences for where they want their nation. Sara wants cold, Nordic/Minnesotan climates, Ath loves his archipelagos, Moarfall wants jungles and a primal atmosphere, and so on. These needs must be met to ensure satisfaction with the map. Throughout the years of my map tending, it is clear, that users care more about where their nation is than what their nations shape is. Shape is important sure, but the local geography really gets them going. So, to answer the question, no, I will not overhaul the planetary geography/landmasses that much. We already did that when we upgraded from 1.0 to 2.0 and I kind of like what we have here. Though, I have noticed when it comes to oceans, we don't have particularly large ones. We have a TON of land. Like I said, my plan is not to overhaul the planet's geography, but it will change. A lot in some places and a little in others. For example, right now we don't have very many small islands, in reality, a planet like ours should have potentially hundreds or thousands of small islands and 3.0 will reflect this. Vari's rejoice! More details on the changes to geography later.

Weather maps are an interesting addition and go hand in hand with geography. The climate is intrinsically tied to the terrain it exits in. A weather layer should be simple to implement. The way I see it, it doesn't need to convey much more than what you see on a standard radar. Here is where the rain is, here is where the snow is, here are the local temps. The occasional monsoon, hurricane, tropical storm, etc. Fun little events that players can react to and RP about. Athretvari's suggestions on this topic are exactly what I am looking for. When the weather changes, (I'll have to decide on a frequency) the Phanon Weather Service releases a brief overview of the current weather, and a prediction of what the next cycles weather could be. Another gold star request.

NPCs are a beast of a topic. They can encompass so much. But before we go into what can do with them, what do we do with them now? NPCs are essentially little punching bags us real nations get to bully for whatever reason we want. It can be scary to try and approach a war scenario with another player, especially if it is not a joint RP, no one wants to lose after all. But NPCs make easy targets to invade, turn into puppets, send aid, and have proxy wars over. All Player Nations fall into about 3 categories, Minor, Major, and Superpowers. Unless a player specifically elects to play as a third world country or a city state, they should be considered to have as much agency as their peers. NPCs on the other hand do not fall into these categories. More like, NPCs can be Developing Nations, Decadent Nations, City States, or Pirate States. An example of each of these; The savages north of Ath, Developing Nation | Gresk, Decadent Nation | The tiny island between 46566 and ODR, Midodr, City State | The Thirsty Armada, Pirate State. This is a rough system to place all the NPCs into. Most of the time, when I placed an NPC on the map, I just sort of thoughtlessly put it there. Only considering the category it ought to be. The lore I left to its Player Nation neighbors. We could very easily have a directory of NPCs. Their attitudes, proclivities, and relative strength. I think it would be fun to have an NCON NPC contest every now and then. Players can make a dispatch about a made-up NPC and then we can vote on whose to add or whose needs a little more work. This is not really a request either but work that must be done, nonetheless.
 
The Vision

Okay, so what does all this mean. Well, my philosophy in life is as follows: "I will either find a way or make one." It's a nice quote and fits me well. In life, I am usually VERY unsatisfied with what options are made available to me. Most software, services, devices, etc. are built with the lowest common denominator in mind. Well, I am not common, and I am no bottom (get it?). To that end, I end up changing the systems I have to work with, and if I can't change it, I build a new one. A couple examples. Windows wouldn't let me control my system to the extent I felt comfortable with, so I switched to Linux. The distros I played with didn't work exactly as I needed them to, so I edited all the configurations. Paint.net started failing me, so I went to GIMP. RPG systems don't work the way I need them to, so I make new rules. Skyrim isn't good enough, so I install over 2000 mods. This is my life, not perfection, but mefection. I just coined that, mefection. Anyway, back to the point. If something isn't working for me, I don't feel motivated to use it. As stated above, this has become an issue with the map, and it's a disservice to all of you. So, with that in mind, let me tell you about my multi-year project so far.

Map 3.0 has had several iterations, ideas, features, and so on. I haven't nailed it down yet, but I am getting closer. I think I have enough now to tell you all what I am making. In making 3.0, I have a few design philosophies in mind.

+ The map must be enjoyable to update.
---Note, I did not say easier, I said enjoyable.
+ The map must be user friendly.
+ The map must be easy for users to make requests.
+ The map must load quickly.
+ The map must have a uniform look.
+ The map must be the best on NS.

But who cares about that, let's get into some of the nitty gritty features and mechanics.

A long-time staple of our maps that has made requests easier and pointing to locations faster has been the almighty hexagon. The hexagon is quite literally, the bestagon. Hexes will remain in 3.0 and will be even more relevant to the map than ever before. Currently, we have rather large hexagons, this makes detailing your borders and claims a bit tricky and can cause nations to be much larger than they probably should be. The 2.0 map has 2870 hexes. 3.0 was going to have over 5 million. Quite a jump huh? Thats an increase of 1,742 times! Too big. After mathing it out, I think I have settled around 250,000 - 500,000. Still quite a few but not beyond the pale. Why am I doing this? I am trying to make each hex have a more relevant size. I want each hex to be about the size of a mid-sized metropolitan area, about 2,000 sq kilometers. The area of the earth is about 510 million sq kilometers. So if each hex is about 2,000 and the Earth (our general reference for Delta's size) is about 510 million, then some simple math gives us about 250,000 hexes. I feel comfortable rounding numbers around, so we can say Delta is 500 million sq kilometers. Just a bit smaller than the Earth. Sue me. So, what does this do exactly and why am I making this change?

I am working on a large sprite sheet. For those of you that don't know, most 2D games and graphics are presented as sprites. From the first sentence on the Wikipedia entry on sprites: "In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game." My sprite sheet is basically a tile map. I am making a hexagonal representation of various terrain, water, mountains, etc. My tile map will probably be completed at around 200 assets. This will make the map more detailed than ever. Probably almost too detailed, but we'll cross that bridge when we get there. From this point I will then begin the PAINSTAKING process of building the entire world of Delta, tile by tile. (In reality, I will probably automate this process) Once I have a general shape of the landmasses, I will go into the finer details, nice edges, mountain ranges, lakes, rivers, etc. Once this is done, for all map claims going forward, when you claim a hex, you get the whole hex, and not some arbitrary part of its neighbor hexes.

The artwork for this project should hopefully convey a more vibrant world. You get a chance to really see what terrain you are dealing with and should give me the fidelity I am looking for. Thankfully, I can scale the artwork as I need, so if I decide on fewer hexes, the assets will get larger but shouldn't have any problems with aliasing. I look forward to your thoughts and feelings on this, maybe you have a better suggestion for what the size of each hex should be. Alright, next topic.

I mentioned in a previous post, I want the map to be smart. Now, I have a lot of ideas for what that could mean, so lets go over some of my ideas. Ill put them into 3 categories. Likely, potentially, maybe. I know, real specific.

--LIKELY--
+ When you hover over a nation, I want the map to highlight its borders, and give you a tooltip about that nation.
+ I want buttons on the page that when you click them, allow you to change the layers. i.e. Weather, political, terrain, unions, etc.
+ Icons for current events that link to the related RP post.
--POTENTIALLY--
+ Animations. I think it would be really cool to have even basic animations on the map, maybe a tiny ship sailing along one of those trade routes, or a plane flying through the air. IDK. Not super important but would be nice.
+ Random events.
+ Transit paths
--MAYBE--
+ A login for nations to make their own updates and adjustments to their nation.
+ Economic activity.
+ Warzones.

I can't go into exact detail about each of these right now since this post is already humungous but I am happy to dive deeper and discuss it after this main post is out.

Conclusion

I have been studying and practicing for a while now both art and programming. I want a system that yes, will require a lot on the front end, but once it's in, it will be glorious. BUT I NEED YOUR HELP. I need suggestions, feedback, and if you can, technical help. Also, ride my ass if I slow down. And one more thing. After I return from a convention I am going to (March 29-31) I will release my assets and notes on the project. I have a repo where the project is kept, and you will get to see in real time my progress and process.

I look forward to the discussion we will have as a result of this post. I'm not going to proofread this whole thing so take it as it is.

Yours,
Nedea

P.S. The discussion we had here page=rmb/postid=46837107 hasn't left my mind either.

Did you really reread that entire thing? Well, if ya did, you know the full extent of my original ambitions with this project. And if you've been keeping an eye on the RMB recently, you'll know I've already made comments on this subject. Regardless, this project has been a blast so far. And I know you might be wondering, "Gee Nedea, when did you get all this energy to actually touch your damn map?"

![Babe update me]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/updateMeme.jpg)


Distractions, and enthusiasm. That's what kept getting in my way. When you become a cartographer, there is so much you want to do to make your map beautiful and user friendly. Despite my efforts, I kept getting lost in the sauce. "*OOOOH* what is this shiny thing?" "I wonder if I could make it do that?" Or my personal favorite, "Oh snap, I was supposed to be working on that map wasn't I?"

Enthusiasm makes or breaks any project, and as I mentioned before, there are a multitude of reasons why my enthusiam waxes or wanes. Whether it's just my personal life getting in the way, the RMB quieting, participation in certain RP events, a new project, or just sheer laziness, it happens. And the biggest reason it wanes, is because of my documentation.

Now there is a keyword, documentation. It's important. Remember taking notes in school? Remember *documenting* what the instructor was teaching you? Yea, I do. The **biggest** hurdle to progress was my own crappy documentation. Truthfully, I could not even tell you *how* to update the 2.0 map if you asked me to. It got out of control and then one sabbatical later, I have no idea what I am even looking at. So what is the reason for all this ambition flowing through me?

This repository. Gone are the days where I discuss something interesting and it's gone to the wind. No longer will we invent something only for it to be lost a few weeks later. Now that *everything* can be documented, saved, explored, invented, discussed, and reviewed within this repository, we can actually keep track of the entire project. If I need to take a week off, I won't be lost when I come back. That's why. Because no matter how far I get, I know the project will be safe, and understandable to future me. It won't become the quagmire of insanity it always drifts towards.

And hey, BTW, I love getting lost in the sauce. I love exploring all sorts of neato things to add or investigate further. But Ath was right, I need to dial things back sometimes and just get a minimal viable product out. When I refounded this great region, I did so not to just preserve our decade plus heritage, I did so to reignite that flame we had long ago. It is to no one's surprise NCON has been in a timeless sunset for like, what? 5 or 6 years? Wow, that is a long time. That means for at least a third of my NS career, I've just been a bump on a log.

I know most of us are in a sort of "NS retirement". We did the thing, we tried to do more things, we had a good time, and we chat a little. Meanwhile we slowly dwindle down to nothing. Leaving behind only a wimper as the last of us quietly disengage and move on. And that's fine. Really, if you want to retire, I have no problem with that. 

I love you guys, or at least what's left of you guys. And we may never see a return to the glory days of past, but that doesn't mean I won't try. There are thousands of nations looking for a home like ours. All we have to do is pick up the pieces and restore our monument. My ultimate goal is to rebuild what we have to at least a fraction of what we had. Then, when the time comes, we pass the torch. We hand off the mantle of NCON to our successors. I hand off this repository to a trusted newby, and we all go get drinks. Knowing our legacy is preserved forever within this repo. 

In closing, I just want to say, I don't expect anything from any of you. I know some of you have a little spark left in you for some creativity, and all I ask is you put it to use somewhere. I'll keep plugging away at this project. Dutifully updating the map, carefully cataloging our Roleplays, curiously investigating new activities, and intentionally archiving our history with one another.

Our motto is "Yield not to misfortune!" for a reason.

We won't.

*Ne Cede Malis!*
