  <h2>About Nedea</h2>
  <p>The Syndicated Corporations of Nedea is a gargantuan, orderly nation, ruled by Drake Fairtrade with an iron fist, and remarkable for its ubiquitous missile silos, complete lack of public education, and spontaneously combusting cars. The hard-nosed, hard-working, cynical, humorless population of 31.326 billion Nedeans are ruled with an iron fist by the corrupt, dictatorship government, which oppresses anyone who isn't on the board of a Fortune 500 company. Large corporations tend to be above the law, and use their financial clout to gain ever-increasing government benefits at the expense of the poor and unemployed.</p>

  <h2>History of Nedea</h2>
  <p>The minute, corrupt, pro-business, well-organized government, or what there is of one, juggles the competing demands of Defense, Industry, and Law & Order. It meets to discuss matters of state in the capital city of DarkHaven. Income tax is unheard of.

The frighteningly efficient Nedean economy, worth an astonishing 12,070 trillion Kredits a year, is driven almost entirely by the private sector, which is broadly diversified and led by the Arms Manufacturing industry, with major contributions from Information Technology, Retail, and Gambling. Average income is an amazing 385,326 Kredits, but there is a large disparity between incomes, with the richest 10% of citizens earning 1,914,233 per year while the poor average 43,879, a ratio of 43.6 to 1.

A small country is wondering where their capitol building's gold dome went, you can't make an omelet without breaking a few legs, business ambassadors offer bong tokes to foreign leaders, and molehills are the only mountains deemed safe enough for the public. Crime, especially youth-related, is all-pervasive, perhaps because of the country's complete lack of prisons. Nedea's national animal is the Pony, which teeters on the brink of extinction due to widespread deforestation.</p>
